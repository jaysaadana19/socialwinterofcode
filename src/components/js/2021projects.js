    Description: `1. Checkpoint is a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool that helps in creating restore/history points in our project and allows users to go back and forth between different restore points. 

    2. The concept is very similar to something called tagging in git CLI tool. The major difference being checkpoint doesn’t need the project to be git initialized. 
    Checkpoint introduces a new approach for eliminating the need to git initialize a project and host it on GitHub and then run extensive git commands just to create an archive version of the project. With checkpoint creating a backup is as simple as writing a single line of command in the terminal.
    
    3. This enables it to work with essentially any type of project. This means the project need not be a technical project, it can be a directory containing an essay. We can create restore points for that essay so that we can compare different iteration of the same essay with each other and pick the best version.
    
    4. Also, checkpoint brings multiple sequence classes that allow a user to easily initialize checkpoint in various environments and even define his/her custom sequence. Currently, checkpoint has a CLI sequence which allows checkpoint to work in a command-line environment.`,

    Description: `FireflyJS is an ODM(Object Document Model) for Firestore. To maintain data consistency in a particular collection, we run schema validation before every write. For using firefly, you first need to describe the type of data you want to store in a particular collection and define the corresponding object schema. The schema would validate your data on creating and updating it before adding it to the collection. You can specify required/default keys and perform checks related to the structure of the input data to ensure that only valid data makes it to the database. Once the schema is defined, now you are ready to make a model for this. With the model available to you, you can query the data, perform update operations, etc. You can perform compound queries, structure the queried data however you want with sort, limit, startAt, etc.
    On top of that, you can also use operators like $gte(greater than or equal), $in, etc, to query the appropriate documents. The result of the query would be either a single instance or an array of Documents. You can read data, update, delete this document. Hence firefly greatly smoothens the interaction with firestore, also adding schema validation, structuring data, etc.

    Description: `This project is an outcome of the requirement of one of my professor from me as a class representative. I created a attendance management system using django framework, ajax, jquery, javascript, bootstrap, css and HTML. The goal of the project is to create a web app where students can login using their provided credentials and mark their attendance for the class. It uses forms and validators to stop marking attendance for the day other than today. It also enables the admin to download the attendance of the given date in CSV format. The attendance form is only available for users, when the admin allows it.
    Key Features
    1) The homepage contains the data of every student of the department.
    2) The subjects section contains, the subject currently active.
    3) A login system where users with credentials can only login and mark their attendance using the form.
    4) The form has custom validators which allows it to take attendance effectively.
    5) The form is only visible to the normal users when the admin allows it through its admin homepage, which he can access after logging in on the website, with his credentials.
    6) The admin can download the attendance for the day in CSV form from his homepage.
    7) Admin has a pause and start button which controls the availability of the attendance form for the normal users on the website.
    8) The project has also been dockerized.`,

    Description: `I have seen many people emphasizing how you can learn anything from the internet very easily and I also believe that the internet is a great leveler.
    But the problems are :
    1)There is no structure of content 
    2) Many options for the same thing sometimes gets overwhelming, which is not a great sign for a beginner in any field
    3) People claiming themselves the best and then FORCING you to buy their paid service as a free one is incomplete 
    4) Time wastage. We search a lot for good resources and usually end up wasting hours just searching. 
    
    Keeping all the above points in mind, I started CSwaala.
    It is a platform containing all the resources that are required to learn something that's already on the Internet. The benefit is that all these resources are curated by individuals who have already learned the skill, so they know the in and outs and are adding only those resources which really helped them.`,
