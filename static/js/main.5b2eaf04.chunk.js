After the set up process, you simply say the word \u2018Alexa\u2019 and Echo will light up and Alexa will respond. You can change this 'wake word' to either 'Amazon' or 'Echo'. Alexa can help you with music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, as well as providing weather, traffic and other real-time information.\n\n    \ud83d\udcbb What\u2019s a skill?\n    Alexa skills are like apps. You can enable and disable skills, using the Alexa app or a web browser, in the same way that you install and uninstall apps on your smart phone or tablet. Skills are voice-driven Alexa capabilities. You can add Alexa skills to your Echo to bring products and services to life. You can view available skills and enable or disable them using your Alexa app.\n\n    \ud83d\udcbb Where do I find my skills?\n    You'll find all the skills on your Alexa app. If you're looking for the EDF Energy Alexa skill to complete the account linking process, type 'EDF Energy' in the search box.

After the set up process, you simply say the word \u2018Alexa\u2019 and Echo will light up and Alexa will respond. You can change this 'wake word' to either 'Amazon' or 'Echo'. Alexa can help you with music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, as well as providing weather, traffic and other real-time information.\n\n    \ud83d\udcbb What\u2019s a skill?\n    Alexa skills are like apps. You can enable and disable skills, using the Alexa app or a web browser, in the same way that you install and uninstall apps on your smart phone or tablet. Skills are voice-driven Alexa capabilities. You can add Alexa skills to your Echo to bring products and services to life. You can view available skills and enable or disable them using your Alexa app.\n\n    \ud83d\udcbb Where do I find my skills?\n    You'll find all the skills on your Alexa app. If you're looking for the EDF Energy Alexa skill to complete the account linking process, type 'EDF Energy' in the search box.
