Checkpoint is a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool that helps in creating restore/history points in our project and allows users to go back and forth between different restore points.\xa0\n\n    2. The concept is very similar to something called tagging in git CLI tool. The major difference being checkpoint doesn\u2019t need the project to be git initialized.\xa0\n    Checkpoint introduces a new approach for eliminating the need to git initialize a project and host it on GitHub and then run extensive git commands just to create an archive version of the project. With checkpoint creating a backup is as simple as writing a single line of command in the terminal.\n    \n    3. This enables it to work with essentially any type of project. This means the project need not be a technical project, it can be a directory containing an essay. We can create restore points for that essay so that we can compare different iteration of the same essay with each other and pick the best version.\n    \n    4. Also, checkpoint brings multiple sequence classes that allow a user to easily initialize checkpoint in various environments and even define his/her custom sequence. Currently, checkpoint has a CLI sequence which allows checkpoint to work in a command-line environment.",TechStack:["Python","CLI","Testing","UI"]},{Name:"Developer Empire",Repo:"https://github.com/swapnilsparsh/DevEmpire/",Owner:"Swapnil Srivastava",github:"https://github.com/swapnilsparsh",linkedin:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/swapnil-srivastava-sparsh/",Description:"All in one place where you can find all the resources and details of ambassador/fellowship, open-source events, web dev sites, js toolkits and etc. that are available across different sites.

Before COVID, we had around 100 students, from the 4 villages adopted by us in the vicinity of our institute, who used to come to our institute in the evening to take classes.\n    Apart from the basic classes, we also prepare students of Class 5 for Navodaya Entrance Examination and we\'ve received great results in past years where one of our students got selected in Navodaya in 2018, one in 2019 and two in 2020.\n    So, this project is a little initiative from my side to help volunteers manage the classes and other day-to-day operations at Jagrati in a better way and make it easier for them to keep track of students, classwork-homework given to them, their attendances and other things and focus more on teaching than these side activities.\n    You may find more details about the project here: https://github.com/garg3133/JagratiWebApp"',TechStack:["HTML","CSS","Bootstrap4","VanillaJS","Python","Django"]},{Name:"Sampark",Repo:"https://github.com/The-Robotics-Forum/sampark",Owner:"The Robertics Forum",github:"https://github.com/The-Robotics-Forum",linkedin:"https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-robotics-forum/",Description:"This is a free and open source team chat collaboration platform that allows user to communicate securely in Realtime ,Share File, Location and code snippet as well as create private rooms.",TechStack:["MERN"]},{Name:"Stack Over Flow Tag Predictions",Repo:"https://github.com/Technocolabs100/Stack-Overflow-Tag-Predictions",Owner:"Yasin Shah",github:"https://www.github.com/Yasin-Shah",linkedin:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yasin-shah-139970141/",Description:'"Our classifiers performed reasonably well;\nthey succeeded in predicting at least one\ncorrect tag for many questions correctly, even\nif they did not predict every tag correctly.\n\u2022 Because of the sparsity of the tags present\nin our dataset, we were curious as to\nwhether tag prevalence in the dataset was\nstrongly correlated with the performance of\nthat tag\u2019s corresponding classifier.\n\u2022 However, our analysis showed that a better\ncriterion for success of a classifier is how\nunique its tag is, and if there are other\nwords in the vocabulary which uniquely\nidentify it.\n\u2022 While tags which are easy to predict\nusually correspond to some specific\nkeywords, tags which are difficult to predict\nusually cover a larger subject area, are\nOur more broad, or have many applications."',TechStack:["Data Science","Machine Learning","Data Analysis","Deep learning"]},{Name:"Review My Project",Repo:"https://github.com/Technocolabs100/Stack-Overflow-Tag-Predictions",Owner:"Yasin Shah",github:"https://www.github.com/Yasin-Shah",linkedin:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yasin-shah-139970141/",Description:"Create a Web Application that User Have to Submit your own Project details like working videos, links, photos, and their code to review by Developer experts.",TechStack:["HTML","CSS","Javascript","PHP","Mangodb","MySql Database","React","NODE JS"]},{Name:"PortfolioFy",Repo:"https://github.com/kaustubhgupta/PortfolioFy",Owner:"Kaustubh Gupta",github:"https://github.com/kaustubhgupta",linkedin:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaustubh-gupta-612767ab/",Description:"As a developer we create hundreds of repositories and hardly 15-20 of them actually make it to final project we deploy and showcase on social media/linkedin.
